## About
This project is essentially an Assest Management System which enables Requesting and Releasing of assets across an organisation. This website was made to demonstrate the learnings embibed from my undergraduate course in Web Development. The project covered the following key concepts:

- Server-Side Web Page Development: The project focused on building interactive web pages using ASP.NET server controls and validation controls.
- Integration with SQL Server Database: SQL Server was integrated into the ASP.NET/C# web application, enabling efficient storage and retrieval of data. The application utilized SQL Data Source to perform common database operations such as inserting, updating, deleting, and selecting data from the database, as an enablement for requesting/releasing assets. A custom class was developed within the C#.NET web application, providing structured functions for various database operations, enhancing code modularity and maintainability.
- State Management: State management techniques were implemented to track user logins, website access count, and user information across different pages. Session based authentication mechanisms were employed for this purpose.
- Authentication: The web.config file was configured to support both Windows authentication and forms authentication, ensuring secure access to the web application.
